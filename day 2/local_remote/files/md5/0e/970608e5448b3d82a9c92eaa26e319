DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source tool that brings Git-like version control to data, 
machine learning models, and experiments. It helps teams manage large datasets, track changes, 
collaborate efficiently, 
and ensure full reproducibility of ML workflowsâ€”all without bloating the Git repository.
