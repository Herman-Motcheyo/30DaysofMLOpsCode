# Design Patterns in Python

This project explores three of the most commonly used **behavioral and creational design patterns** for building modular, scalable, and maintainable software, particularly within **Data Science**, **MLOps**, and **intelligent systems** contexts:

- **Strategy Pattern**
- **Template Method Pattern**
- **Factory Pattern**

---

## 1 - Factory Pattern 

The **Factory Pattern** allows you to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It's useful for situations where the creation process involves several steps, and you want to centralize the object creation logic in one place.

## 2 - Strategy Pattern 

The **Strategy Pattern** enables selecting an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime. This pattern allows the client to choose the behavior of the object based on the situation without modifying its class.

## 3 - Template Method Pattern 

The **Template Method Pattern** defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
